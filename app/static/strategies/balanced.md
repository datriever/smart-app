## **Key Performance Indicators**

| **Metric**               | **Value**         |
|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Weighted Cost (LCOE)      | $82.51/MWh        |
| Weighted Carbon Intensity | 149.55 gCO2eq/kWh |

---

This balanced strategy achieves a **reasonable electricity cost of $82.51/MWh** while maintaining **moderate carbon intensity of 149.55 gCO2eq/kWh**. By combining renewables like wind, solar, and hydro with conventional sources such as natural gas and coal, it ensures both cost-effectiveness and a sustainable energy transition for Spain.
